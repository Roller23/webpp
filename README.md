# webpp
A very small and simple HTTP web server framework written in C++

Features:

- Easily create simple endpoints for GET and POST requests
- Send files
- Serve static files
- Write custom headers
- Read query from GET requests

Note: as of now there's no security at all. DO NOT use it in serious production environment!

TODO:

- Implement multithreading/multiplexing
- Add support for more methods
- Automatically detect mime type
- Security improvements
